Minimum client file requirements for first boot:

\ Minecraft instance folder
	\ update.bat
	\ winhttpjs.bat

Specific file information:
--------------------------
Update.bat is the update file in this repository
Winhttpjs.bat is available from https://github.com/npocmaka/batch.scripts/blob/master/hybrids/jscript/winhttpjs.bat under MIT license

Webserver file structure requirements:

\ host variable (i.e. https://puddle.zone)
	\ public_files_dir (i.e. minecraft)
		\ serversync-x.x.xx.jar
		\ serversync-client.cfg (Normally created by ServerSync on first run, but uses localhost as the domain)
		\ sslatest.txt (simple text file with the filename of the current version of ServerSync)

Specific file information:
--------------------------
serversync-x.x.xx.jar is whatever the current version available on Curseforge at https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/serversync
serversync-client.cfg is normally created by ServerSync if it doesn't already exist, however it doesn't have the correct information for clients, so we have to pre-build a custom version
	- 1) Start serversync somewhere on a local machine to generate a default configuration file
	- 2) Open the serversync-client.cfg file that was made (it will be in the /config/serversync folder under the jar file)
	- 3) Replace SERVER_IP and SERVER_PORT with the domain of your Minecraft server and the port you've assigned ServerSync on the server (defaults are 127.0.0.1 and 38067 respectively)
sslatest.txt is a text file with only the name of the serversync jar file listed above.  For instance, at time of writing, the current filename would be serversync-2.6.17.jar, so the contents of the text file whould be a single line with "serversync-2.6.17.jar" (no quotes).  Remember, as with any URI, it is case sensitive

Installation and use:
1) Make a local copy of update.bat and edit the variables in the beginning of the script to match your Minecraft instance 
2) Package the update.bat and winhttpjs.bat files for the client to use
3) Add the appropriate files to your webserver as descripbed above
4) Add and configure ServerSync for your Minecraft server.

Upgrade instrucions:
1) Replace the ServerSync file on the webserver
2) Edit the sslatest.txt file on the webserver to reflect the name of the new version
3) Upgrade ServerSync on the Minecraft instance.
4) That's it!  The next time a client connects, they'll automatically update their ServerSync before launching updates.
